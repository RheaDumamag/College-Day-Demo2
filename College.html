   <h1> College Day Diary </h1>
   <p> Greetings! I would like to share my reflections on the day's experiences <br>
       and provide insight into what our school has prepared for us. <br>
       Below is a collection of my observations throughout the day.</p>

                <h3><u>Bingo Event</u></h3>
                <p>This event was very intense and fun.<br>
                   The prizes are very appealing to win!<br>
                   Unfortunately, I didn't win.</p>
